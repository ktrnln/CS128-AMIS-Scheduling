AMIS VM (notes)

- download virtual box and ubuntu
- open vbox add the vm from the given file

NOTE: kung anong gagamiting wifi sa setup, yun na yung wifi na gagamitin para gumana yung VM ; pwede namang ibang wifi pero you'll have to do the setup again

Look for Wifi Info for Setup:
 settings > network and internet > advanced network settings > click the wifi ur using > view additional properties
    --- take note of description (this will be the name of the ethernet/wifi)
    --- take note of the IPv4 default gateway (10.103.0.3)
    --- we need to have an available IP address from the network (change the last digit of the gateway above - only 2-225)
       -- check if that IP is being used: 
	  1. open terminal as admin (right click windows > terminal (admin))
	  2. ping IP you want to use (e.g.: ping 10.103.0.44) -- IP is available if the response is: destination host unreachable 
	  3. look for 2 available IPs (take note of this)


From the instructions: 
1. Before opening the actual VM (setup the network)
- attached to: Bridged Adapter
- Name: name of ethernet/wifi 
- Promiscuous Mode: Allow all
- Cable connected: checked


Inside the VM: Password -- rootadmin

 2. settings > wired > icon > IPv4
   - IPv4 method: manual
   - addresses (only change the first 2)
	1st - change address (use the first IP kanina) , change gateway (the default gateway kanina rin) --- frontend IP
	2nd - change address (use the 2nd IP)  --- backend IP

 3. files > amis > amis-fe > ctrl+h > .env (open) > save
   - change the IP address to the back-end IP address (2nd IP) > save
	--- may comment si sir look for it as guide

 4. files > amis > amis-be > ctrl+h > .env (open) > save
   - Change the APP_URL IP address to the back-end IP address 
   - Change the FRONT_URL IP address to the front-end IP address
	--- may comment si sir look for it as guide

** setup is successful if you can access internet after the changes in the network **




ACCESSING THE AMIS WEBSITE IN VM

inside amis-fe
- if it exist: package.json > open
- if it exist: dist folder (if there is: project is already built) > open > look for index.html 

https://localhost  -- nginx web server (installed but needed further configuration)

Find Nginx file directory: file manager > other locations > Computer > var > www > html

Vue app/files are being used  -- need to copy vue files from amis-fe/dist/ to Nginx directory
  - open new file manager window > amis > amis-fe > dist > copy all files inside (but not the dist folder) > paste in Nginx directory




Vue app/files are being used  -- need to copy vue files from amis-fe/dist/ to new directory
  - open new file manager window > amis > amis-fe > dist > copy all files inside (but not the dist folder) > paste in new directory (new folder in home)

Change the default dir of Nginx to point at the new folder 
  - file manager > other locations > Computer > etc > nginx > sites-available > default file (copy-paste somewhere first for back-up)
	--- find: /var/www/html;   replace with: /home/amisadmin/folder;
	--- find: index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;    replace with: index index.html index.htm;
  - save > restart > open: https://localhost
